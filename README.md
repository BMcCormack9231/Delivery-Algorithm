This application is a low fidelity simulation of a package delivery operation. 
When run, the Nearest Neighbor algorithm is run using distance values that are stored in a distance matrix to find the closest node (delivery address) to the current location of a truck.
After running the delivery operation, the user can use the CLI to view the status of packages at different times during the day.
Three truck objects are used to deliver the packages. 
Several packages have special restrictions including some that do not arrive until 10:00 am and one that has it's delivery address updated later in the day.
