This application is a low fidelity simulation of a package delivery operation. <br>
When run, the Nearest Neighbor algorithm is used to traverse to each delivery node (delivery address)<br>
A distance matrix stores the distance between each node so that the algorithm can identify the nearest node with polynomial time complexity.<br>
After running the delivery operation, the user can use the CLI to view the status of packages at different times during the day.<br>
Several packages have special restrictions including some that do not arrive until 10:00 am and one that has it's delivery address updated later in the day.
